https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-question-pairs

Quora is a place to gain and share knowledge—about anything. 
It’s a platform to ask questions and connect with people who contribute unique insights and quality answers.
This empowers people to learn from each other and to better understand the world.

We would like to tackle this natural language processing problem using R to classify whether question pairs are duplicates or not.
Doing so will make it easier to find high quality answers to questions resulting in an improved experience for Quora writers, seekers, and readers.	

The script contains a random forest classifier built on similarity measures such as cosine, manhattan distance.

R packages used:
1) DPLYR
2) Snowball
3) Caret
